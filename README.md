# Remote Sikuli Library for Robot Framework
Robot framework library to utilize Sikuli's UI testing capabilities either remotely or locally.

Usage examples can be found at [Tests-folder](/src/test/robotframework/acceptance).

Debug-level logging is quite exhaustive at remote calls, because base64 encoded images are written to logs, too.
